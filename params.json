It brings together [Loopback](http://loopback.io) and\r\n[ng-boilerplate](https://joshdmiller.github.io/ng-boilerplate).\r\n\r\n##Quick Start\r\n\r\n__Note:__ Hopefully, you have your environment set up such that you don't need sudo to do `npm` anything\r\nbut if not, just add sudo where appropriate.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmkdir myApp && cd myApp\r\ngit clone https://carlodicelico.github.com/loopback-ng-boilerplate .\r\ncd server && npm install\r\ncd ../client && npm install && bower install\r\ngrunt compile\r\nnode ../server/app\r\n```\r\n\r\nGo to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You'll probably also want to change the\r\nnames `myApp` and `ngBoilerplate` to your own app's name throughout.\r\n\r\n##Structure\r\n\r\nThe project is set up with two completely independent directories - `/client` and `/server`. They're\r\nboth already set up with individual `.gitignore` files. This is so that you can split these up into\r\ntwo separate git repos if you prefer.\r\n\r\nIn `/server` is a barebones loopback API. There's nothing more here than whatever is normally generated\r\nby `slc lb project myApp` except that `app.js` has been set up to serve the AngularJS app when `/` is\r\nrequested. Loopback will look for the `index.html` file in `/client/bin`, where your compiled and\r\nminified sources will be located in production, and automatically serve it to the client.\r\n\r\nIn `/client`, `grunt-loopback-angular` and `grunt-docular` have been installed and a grunt task called\r\n`loopback` registered in `Gruntfile.js`. The `loopback` task has been added to `default` so that besides\r\nbeing available via `grunt loopback`, it will automatically run when you do `grunt`. An initial\r\n`lb-services.js` file has been generated and injected as a dependency of the angular app.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\nIf you want to work on the client-side app only, you can do so just as you\r\nnormally would with `ng-boilerplate` - run `grunt watch` and open `/client/src/index.html` in your\r\nbrowser.\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready to deploy, you can do `grunt compile` and `node ../server/app`, do a quick\r\nonce-over, and push according to your deployment process. All you need to push to production is `/server`\r\nand `/client/bin`.\r\n\r\nFor information specific to [Loopback](http://loopback.io) or\r\n[ng-boilerplate](https://joshdmiller.github.io/ng-boilerplate), see their respective documentation.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
